Precision			Recall			F-score			Accuracy

		
Accuracy = (TP + TN) / N 
Recall = TP / (TP + FN) 
Precision = TP / (TP + FP) 
F-score = 2 * ((Precision * Recall) \ (Precision + Recall))
N = Total Number of Instances  
									 				
1. True Negative (TN): case negative and system can predict as negative.
2. False Negative (FN): case positive but system predicted as negative.
3. False Positive (FP): case negative but system predicted as positive.
4. True Positive (TP): case positive and system can predict as positive.
